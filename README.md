## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1.AI-Powered Question Generator: Utilize AI and NLP models to analyze a candidate's resume and job role, dynamically generating relevant, role-specific interview questions that adapt in real-time based on candidate responses.

2.Real-Time Answer Evaluation: Implement AI-driven response analysis to evaluate candidate answers based on technical accuracy, relevance, and clarity, assigning instant scores to streamline assessment.

3.Virtual Boardroom Simulation: Create an immersive, real-life interview experience using AI-powered avatars or video-based panels that mimic real interview settings, ensuring a structured and unbiased process.

4.Bias-Free Scoring System: Use machine learning algorithms to identify biases in questioning or scoring patterns, ensuring fair candidate evaluation by recommending balanced question distributions.

5.Candidate Preparation Mode: Offer a practice module where applicants can take mock interviews, receive AI-driven feedback, and improve their technical and communication skills before the actual interview.

6.Interview Analytics Dashboard: Provide interviewers with a real-time analytics dashboard showcasing candidate scores, answer analysis, and comparative rankings, helping panel members make data-driven hiring decisions.
